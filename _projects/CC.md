title: "Charged-Current Interactions in LXe TPCs"
excerpt: "Recent observations of low-lying isomeric states in the nuclear strucutre of \\(^{136}\\)Cs indiciate that charged-current interacitons on \\(^{136}\\) (136Xe-CC) will create time-delayed coincident signals in LXe TPCs such as nEXO. These unique signals can be leveraged for remarkable abckground rejeciton on the order of \\(10^{-9}\\), enabling backgorund free studies in LXe TPCs. In particular, I study how these unique signals can allow nEXO to serve as a background free solar neutrino and dark matter detector, in addition to its primary role as a neutrinoless double beta decay detector.<br/><img src='/images/Andreas_inspired_level_diagram.pdf'>"
