After finalizing the anode design for nEXO, the next goal was to prototype the design. As part of my SCGSR fellowship, I worked with the Gratta nEXO group at Stanford to design and build a prototype charge readout module for nEXO. While previous work had seen the deployment of charge tiles for nEXO, this work constituted the first testing of a full charge module - including the mounting of a CRYO-ASIC in the LXe to read out the charge signals in-situ.
