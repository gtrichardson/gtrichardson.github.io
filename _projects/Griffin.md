The Gamma Ray Infrastructure For Fundamental Investigations of Nuclei (GRIFFIN) is a detector array for perofmraning gamma-ray spetroscopy on nuclei. Housed at TRIUMF, this detector array contaings high purity germanium crysals for gamma-ray detection, as well as LaBr scintillators for fast timing measurements, and silicon detectors for conversion electorn measurements. In December of 2023, we used this array to collect data on the de-excitation of \\(^{136}\\)Cs from it's \\(8^-\\) isomeric state with goal of better understanding the low energy structure of this nucleus and its implication into xenon-bases astroparticle physics.
