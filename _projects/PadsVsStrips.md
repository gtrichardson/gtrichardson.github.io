The current design for nEXO's charge readout system uses a system of 32 strips of gold deposited onto a fused silica substrate. However, one could imagine variations of this design which might improve or worsen performance, such as 64 pads. This project simualtes and benchmarks various potential anode designs, considering aspects such as input capacitence, topological discrimination, and energy resolution in order to determine the optimal design for nEXO.
