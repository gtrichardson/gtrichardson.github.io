#permalink: /publication/Xe136-CC
excerpt: 'Isomeric states of \\(^{136}\\)Cs create a unique time-delayed coincident signal in LXe TPCs, which can be used for background rejection on the order of \\(10^{-9}\\), enabling background-free measurements of solar neutrinos and electron-coupling fermionic dark matter.'
