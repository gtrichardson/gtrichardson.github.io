The nEXO experiments aims to employ a tonne scale liquid xenon time projection chamber to search for the hypothetical neutrinoless double beta decay (0vbb) of \\(^{136}\\)Xe, which can only occur if neutrinos are Majorana fermions. Recent studies of the proposed nEXO detector design indicate that it will enable a search for this interaction with a half-life sensitivity greater than 10\\(^{28}\\) yrs. In order to achieve this goal, nEXO must collect and reconstruct the charge deposited by candidate 0vbb events with sub-percent accuracy. This talk will summarize the simulation of charge collection in nEXO and the algorithms being developed for optimally reconstructing the energy and location of charge deposits in the detector.
