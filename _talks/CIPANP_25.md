Due to recently observed low-lying isomeric states in Cs, charged-current interactions in liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs) of the form Xe are expected to create time-delayed coincident signals that can be used for background rejection on the order of , enabling background-free searches. In this talk we will discuss the capabilities of nEXO, a proposed 5 tonne enriched LXe TPC designed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay, to use this channel to study solar neutrinos and search for fermionic dark matter. In the case of solar neutrinos, we find that nEXO can expect to measure the flux of CNO neutrinos with comparable precision to world-leading results, and to improve sensitivity to a shift in the Be energy spectrum by an order of magnitude. In the case of fermionic dark matter, we find that nEXO could increase searchable parameter space by up to four orders of magnitude.
