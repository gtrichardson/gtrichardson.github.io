nEXO aims to employ a 5-tonne liquid xenon time projection chamber enriched to 90% in \\(^{136}\\)Xe. Thanks to recent observations of long-lived excited 136Cs states, the nEXO detector has the potential to serve as a solar neutrino observatory in addition to its primary goal of neutrino-less double beta decay detection. In this talk, I will discuss the projected capabilities of nEXO to use charged-current (\\(\nu_{e}\\), \\(^{136}\\)Xe) interactions to measure the CNO and \\(pep\\) solar-neutrino fluxes, as well as the energy of the \\(^7\\)Be solar-neutrinos. I will also contextualize the expected results of these measurements relative to the current measurements made by the Borexino and KamLAND collaborations
