Thanks to recent observations of long-lived excited Cesium-136 states, xenon detectors now have the potential to serve as solar neutrino observatories by using charged-current interactions of the form . This new detection method will be particularly potent at the kilotonne scale. In this lightning talk, I will discuss the projected capabilities of a theoretical kilotonne LXe detector to measure the CNO, pep, and  solar-neutrino fluxes, as well as the energy of the  solar-neutrinos. I will also contextualize these predicted capabilities relative to the current measurements made by the Borexino and Kamland collaborations.
